** WARNING The Legacy Drawing API is being deprecated in v0.25.0**

A flag must be used after v0.24.5 to use the legacy drawing api, you cannot mix it with new
[Graphics API](/docs/graphics)

```typescript
ex.Flags.enable('use-legacy-drawing');
const game = new ex.Engine(...)
```

## Sprites

To create a [[LegacyDrawing.Sprite]] you need to have a loaded [[LegacyDrawing.Texture]] resource. You can
then use [[LegacyDrawing.Texture.asSprite]] to quickly create a [[LegacyDrawing.Sprite]] or you can create
a new instance of [[Sprite]] using the constructor. This is useful if you
want to "slice" out a portion of an image or if you want to change the dimensions.

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txPlayer = new ex.LegacyDrawing.Texture('/assets/tx/player.png')
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txPlayer])

// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  // create a sprite (quick)
  const playerSprite = txPlayer.asSprite()
  // create a sprite (custom)
  const playerSprite = new ex.LegacyDrawing.Sprite(txPlayer, 0, 0, 80, 80)
})
```

You can then assign an [[Actor]] a sprite through [[Actor.addDrawing]] and
[[Actor.setDrawing]].

## Sprite Sheets

You can also use a [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteFont]] which is special kind of [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet]] for use
with [[Label|Labels]].

### Creating a SpriteSheet

To create a [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet]] you need a loaded [[LegacyDrawing.Texture]] resource.

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txAnimPlayerIdle = new ex.LegacyDrawing.Texture(
  '/assets/tx/anim-player-idle.png'
)
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txAnimPlayerIdle])

// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  const player = new ex.Actor()

  // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
  const playerIdleSheet = new ex.LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet(
    txAnimPlayerIdle,
    5,
    1,
    80,
    80
  )

  // create animation (125ms frame speed)
  const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125)

  // add drawing to player as "idle"
  player.addDrawing('idle', playerIdleAnimation)
  // add player to game
  game.add(player)
})
```

### Creating animations

[[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet|SpriteSheets]] provide a quick way to generate a new [[LegacyDrawing.Animation]] instance.

You can use _all_ the frames of a texture using [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]]
or you can use a range of frames ([[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet.getAnimationBetween]]) or you
can use specific frames ([[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet.getAnimationByIndices]]).

To create an animation these methods must be passed an instance of [[Engine]].
It's recommended to generate animations for an actor [during initialization](/docs/actors#initialization) because the engine is passed to the initialization function. However, if your
engine instance is in the global scope, you can create an animation at any time
provided the texture has been [loaded](/docs/assets).

```js
// create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
const playerIdleSheet = new ex.LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet(
  txAnimPlayerIdle,
  5,
  1,
  80,
  80
)

// create animation for all frames (125ms frame speed)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125)
// create animation for a range of frames (2-4) (125ms frame speed)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationBetween(game, 1, 3, 125)
// create animation for specific frames 2, 4, 5 (125ms frame speed)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationByIndices(
  game,
  [1, 3, 4],
  125
)
// create a repeating animation (ping-pong)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationByIndices(
  game,
  [1, 3, 4, 3, 1],
  125
)
```

<!-- TODO: Examples -->

### Multiple rows

Sheets are organized in "row major order" which means left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
Indexes are zero-based, so while you might think to yourself the first column is
column "1", to the engine it is column "0". You can easily calculate an index
of a frame using this formula:

    Given: col = 5, row = 3, columns = 10
    index = col + row * columns
    index = 4 + 2 * 10 // zero-based, subtract 1 from col & row
    index = 24

You can also simply count the frames of the image visually starting from the top left
and beginning with zero.

```js
// get a sprite for column 3, row 6
const sprite = animation.getSprite(2 + 5 * 10)
```

## Animations

### Creating an animation

Create a [[LegacyDrawing.Texture]] that contains the frames of your animation. Once the texture
is [[Loader|loaded]], you can then generate an [[LegacyDrawing.Animation]] by creating a [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet]]
and using [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]].

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txAnimPlayerIdle = new ex.LegacyDrawing.Texture(
  '/assets/tx/anim-player-idle.png'
)
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txAnimPlayerIdle])
// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  const player = new ex.Actor()

  // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
  const playerIdleSheet = new ex.LegacyDrawing.SpriteSheet(
    txAnimPlayerIdle,
    5,
    1,
    80,
    80
  )

  // create animation (125ms frame speed)
  const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125)

  // add drawing to player as "idle"
  player.addDrawing('idle', playerIdleAnimation)
  // add player to game
  game.add(player)
})
```

## Sprite Fonts

### Generating the font sheet

You can use tools such as [Bitmap Font Builder](http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/) to
generate a sprite sheet for you to load into Excalibur.

### Creating a sprite font

Start with an image with a grid containing all the letters you want to support.

Once you load it into Excalibur using a [[LegacyDrawing.Texture]] resource, you can create
a [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteFont]] using the constructor.

For example, here is a representation of a font sprite sheet for an uppercase alphabet
with 4 columns and 7 rows:

```
ABCD
EFGH
IJKL
MNOP
QRST
UVWX
YZ
```

Each letter is 30x30 and after Z is a blank one to represent a space.

Then to create the [[LegacyDrawing.SpriteFont]]:

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txFont = new ex.LegacyDrawing.Texture('/assets/tx/font.png')
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txFont])

// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  // create a font
  const font = new ex.LegacyDrawing.SpriteFont(
    txFont,
    'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ',
    true,
    4,
    7,
    30,
    30
  )
  // create a label using this font
  const label = new ex.Label('Hello World', 0, 0, null, font)
  // display in-game
  game.add(label)
})
```

If you want to use a lowercase representation in the font, you can pass `false` for `caseInsensitive`
and the matching will be case-sensitive. In our example, you would need another 7 rows of
lowercase characters.

### Font colors

When using sprite fonts with a [[Label]], you can set the [[Label.color]] property
to use different colors.

### Known Issues

**One font per Label**  
[Issue #172](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/172)

If you intend on changing colors or applying opacity effects, you have to use
a new [[SpriteFont]] instance per [[Label]].

**Using opacity removes other effects**  
[Issue #148](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/148)

If you apply any custom effects to the sprites in a SpriteFont, including trying to
use [[Label.color]], they will be removed when modifying [[Label.opacity]].
